"Distance:",distance,"cm" :

f = open("reading.txt", "w")
f.write("the distance is: (%d) centimeters" % distance)
f.close()
After running the script, you should have a text file called “reading.txt”.

Now you can play it with espeak using the following line:

espeak -f reading.txt
You can also combine these two commands into a bash file so that you can execute both of them at once. So first create a bash file:

touch tell_distance.bash
Then open the file by:

nano tell_distance.bash
And write there the following two lines:

sudo python range_sensor.py
espeak -f reading.txt
and then “ctrl + x” to exit and “y” to save it. Then you need to make the file executable with:

chmod +x tell_distance.bash
and finally you can run it with ./tell_distance.bash.

You might need to set the sound output on your raspberry pi to analogue, you can do that by typing this to the terminal:

amixer cset numid=3 1
(amixer cset numid=3 2 will set it to HDMI)
